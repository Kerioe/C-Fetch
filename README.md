###### *A version of neofetch written in C. Just a little side project.*

I got bored one day and thought that it would be a cool idea if neofetch was written in C. 

So I sat down one weekend and started working on it.

Its not finshed yet, and I am working on getting it to display more of your pc spects.

## Supported Operating Systems
###### So far C Fetch is only on linux. But I may port it over to windows.
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Arch
- Manjaro

More are soon to come(*Gentoo*).

It does run on MacOS(*being unix based*), But I have not programmed a logo for it.
